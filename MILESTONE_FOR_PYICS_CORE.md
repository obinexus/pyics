## Domain-by-Domain Cost Analysis

### üìÅ core/primitives
- **Problem Solved**: Atomic operation foundation providing thread-safe, deterministic building blocks with zero dependencies
- **Separation Rationale**: Mathematical primitives must remain isolated to prevent dependency contamination and ensure atomic operation guarantees. Cannot be merged due to foundational dependency level 0 requirements.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 1 (highest priority - foundational dependency)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.1 (minimal computational overhead, O(1) operations)
  - `exposure_type`: core_internal (never exposed beyond core boundary)
- **Merge Potential**: **PRESERVE** - Critical foundation requiring complete isolation

### üìÅ core/protocols
- **Problem Solved**: Type safety contracts and interface definitions for cross-domain communication without implementation logic
- **Separation Rationale**: Interface definitions must remain implementation-agnostic to support protocol evolution and type checking. Mixing with implementations would violate interface segregation principle.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 1 (highest priority - type system foundation)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.05 (type checking overhead only, no runtime cost)
  - `exposure_type`: version_required (exposed to version modules for type compliance)
- **Merge Potential**: **PRESERVE** - Interface definitions require strict isolation

### üìÅ core/structures
- **Problem Solved**: Immutable data container definitions ensuring zero-mutation state management across calendar operations
- **Separation Rationale**: Data structure definitions require isolation from transformation logic to maintain immutability guarantees and enable independent validation.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 2 (high priority - data foundation)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.2 (dataclass instantiation and validation overhead)
  - `exposure_type`: version_required (core data structures used by all versions)
- **Merge Potential**: **PRESERVE** - Data integrity requires dedicated domain

### üìÅ core/composition
- **Problem Solved**: Lambda calculus function composition providing mathematical foundation for pipeline construction
- **Separation Rationale**: Mathematical composition operations require dedicated domain to ensure correctness of function composition laws and enable optimization of composition chains.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 2 (high priority - mathematical foundation)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.3 (function composition overhead scales with chain length)
  - `exposure_type`: version_required (composition primitives used by all transformation pipelines)
- **Merge Potential**: **PRESERVE** - Mathematical operations require dedicated optimization

### üìÅ core/validators
- **Problem Solved**: Input/output validation for data integrity checking and constraint enforcement
- **Separation Rationale**: Validation logic requires separation from business transformations to enable independent testing and reuse across multiple transformation contexts.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 3 (medium-high priority - data integrity critical)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.4 (validation computation scales with data complexity)
  - `exposure_type`: version_required (validation used throughout version implementations)
- **Merge Potential**: **MERGE CANDIDATE** with `validation` - Overlapping validation concerns

### üìÅ core/validation
- **Problem Solved**: Data integrity validation and immutability constraint enforcement
- **Separation Rationale**: Currently overlaps significantly with `validators` domain, creating architectural redundancy and potential confusion.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 3 (medium-high priority - data integrity critical)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.4 (similar validation overhead to validators)
  - `exposure_type`: core_internal (internal validation mechanisms)
- **Merge Potential**: **MERGE REQUIRED** - Consolidate with `validators` to eliminate redundancy

### üìÅ core/transformations
- **Problem Solved**: Pure transformation function library for stateless calendar data processing
- **Separation Rationale**: Business transformation logic requires dedicated domain to enable independent testing, optimization, and version-specific extension.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 4 (medium priority - business logic layer)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.6 (transformation computation varies by business complexity)
  - `exposure_type`: version_required (transformation functions used by all versions)
- **Merge Potential**: **SPLIT CANDIDATE** - Consider separating core transforms from business-specific transforms

### üìÅ core/transforms
- **Problem Solved**: Legacy transformation utilities (appears to be superseded by `transformations`)
- **Separation Rationale**: Redundant with `transformations` domain, creating architectural confusion and maintenance overhead.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 9 (low priority - legacy/redundant)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.3 (unused legacy overhead)
  - `exposure_type`: core_internal (deprecated internal usage)
- **Merge Potential**: **ELIMINATE** - Consolidate functionality into `transformations` and remove

### üìÅ core/registry
- **Problem Solved**: Global component registry providing thread-safe transformation registration and discovery
- **Separation Rationale**: Registry functionality requires dedicated domain to manage component lifecycle and enable dynamic composition without circular dependencies.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 5 (medium priority - coordination layer)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.5 (registry lookup and thread synchronization overhead)
  - `exposure_type`: version_required (registry used for component discovery)
- **Merge Potential**: **PRESERVE** - Central coordination requires dedicated management

### üìÅ core/routing
- **Problem Solved**: Execution coordination and transformation pipeline routing through registered components
- **Separation Rationale**: Execution routing requires separation from registry to enable independent optimization of execution pathways and routing algorithms.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 6 (medium priority - execution coordination)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.7 (routing computation scales with pipeline complexity)
  - `exposure_type`: version_required (routing used for pipeline execution)
- **Merge Potential**: **PRESERVE** - Execution coordination complexity justifies separation

### üìÅ core/safety
- **Problem Solved**: Thread-safety utilities and concurrent execution guards for multi-threaded calendar operations
- **Separation Rationale**: Thread-safety mechanisms require dedicated domain to enable systematic testing and optimization of concurrent execution patterns.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 7 (lower priority - cross-cutting concerns)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.3 (thread synchronization overhead)
  - `exposure_type`: core_internal (safety utilities used internally)
- **Merge Potential**: **PRESERVE** - Thread-safety complexity requires dedicated attention

### üìÅ core/logic
- **Problem Solved**: Legacy logic utilities (appears to overlap with composition and primitives)
- **Separation Rationale**: Redundant with established domains, creating architectural confusion and maintenance overhead.
- **Cost Function**:
  - `priority_index`: 10 (lowest priority - legacy/redundant)
  - `compute_time_weight`: 0.2 (unused legacy overhead)
  - `exposure_type`: core_internal (deprecated internal usage)
- **Merge Potential**: **ELIMINATE** - Merge useful functionality into appropriate domains and remove

## Architectural Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Consolidation Requirements

**High Priority Merges:**
1. **Merge `validation` ‚Üí `validators`**: Eliminate redundant validation domains
2. **Eliminate `transforms`**: Consolidate into `transformations` domain
3. **Eliminate `logic`**: Distribute functionality to appropriate domains

**Domain Consolidation Strategy:**
```
validators/ (consolidated validation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementations/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data_integrity.py (from validation/)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input_validation.py (from validators/)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constraint_enforcement.py (consolidated)

transformations/ (enhanced transformation library)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementations/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pure_transforms.py (existing)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ legacy_transforms.py (from transforms/)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ business_transforms.py (business-specific)
```

### Performance Optimization Pathway

**Priority-Based Loading Order:**
