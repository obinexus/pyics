Pyics Core Domain: logic/functional

Engineering Lead: Nnamdi Okpala / OBINexus Computing
Domain: logic/functional
Responsibility: Domain initialization and export interface
Compute Weight: Minimal (import-time only)

PROBLEM SOLVED: Centralized domain module exports and initialization
DEPENDENCIES: Domain-specific modules (data_types, relations, operations)
THREAD SAFETY: Yes - static exports only
DETERMINISTIC: Yes - immutable module structure

This module provides the public interface for the logic/functional domain,
exposing core data types, relations, and operations following DOP principles.
